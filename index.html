          <h1>Loki Laufeyson is the best Loki</h1>
          <p>
            He is a frostgiant raised as an Asgardian. Him being adopted and
            lied to about that led him down a path where he did some dark stuff
            like trying to kill his adopted father, instead killing his real
            father, and then committing genocide on his own race. He then
            floated into space for a while, then he tried to conquer earth.
            Didn't go in his favor, hulk smashed. He then accidently killed the
            only person who made him feel loved, then he had a reedemation ark
            and died instead of teleporting him and Thor to safety, or even
            Thanos and the black order into the sun with the tesseract. When you
            aren't evil, you are dumb.
